**Module 1 — Introduction (Summary)**
This module provides the foundational concepts of data analysis using Python. It introduces the overall workflow of data analysis, the tools commonly used in the field, and the basics of working with datasets.
The key topics covered in this module include:
1. Understanding a Data Problem
   I learned how data analysis is used to solve real-world problems. This includes identifying the question to be answered, understanding the analytical goal, and determining what type of data is needed.
2. Exploring a Dataset
   The module explains how to examine a dataset by checking its structure, attributes (features), data types, and general characteristics. This is done using basic exploratory techniques with Pandas.
3. Python Packages for Data Analysis
   I was introduced to several important Python libraries widely used in data science, including:
   - Pandas — for data manipulation and analysis
   - NumPy — for numeric and array operations
   - Matplotlib / Seaborn — for data visualization
   These packages form the core toolkit for performing analysis in Python.
4. Importing and Exporting Data
   I learned how to load data from various file formats such as CSV and Excel, and how to export processed data back to files. Functions commonly used include:
   - pd.read_csv()
   - df.to_csv()
   - pd.read_excel()
5. Obtaining Basic Insights
   The module covers simple but essential techniques to gain initial insights from data, such as:
   - Displaying the first few rows using df.head()
   - Checking data types with df.dtypes
   - Getting descriptive statistics with df.describe()
   These steps help build an early understanding of the dataset before moving on to more complex analysis.

**Learning Outcome**
By completing Module 1, I gained the foundational skills needed to work with data in Python, including loading datasets, inspecting their structure, and using essential libraries. This module sets the stage for deeper topics such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and model development in the later modules.
